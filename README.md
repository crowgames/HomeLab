HomeLab enables you to secure and understand the network traffic in your Smart Home.
It visualizes and analyzes the traffic of your network.

## Features
  + Network inspection without a need for dedicated hardware (run it on e.g. RaspberryPi)
  + Visualization of global communication partners
  + Visualization of network share by device

If not already available install Nmap on the target system:

Linux:
```
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

Windows:

```

## Start software
Open a terminal and enter:

Linux:

## Roadmap
  - [ ] Login to dashboard
  - [ ] Router port and UPnP inspection
  - [ ] Anomaly detection
  - [ ] HomeLab as Smart Home trigger (e.g. "Dimm the light when smart tv plays Netflix video")
  - [ ] [ < place for your ideas > ](by creating a new issue)
